## Design System Integration

### Color Palette
- Primary: Blue (#0066CC) - Trust, reliability
- Success: Green (#00CC66) - Agent healthy, job completed
- Warning: Amber (#FF9900) - Attention needed, degraded performance  
- Error: Red (#CC0000) - Agent down, job failed
- Neutral: Gray scale for backgrounds and text

### Typography
- Headers: Bold, clear hierarchy (H1-H6)
- Body: High readability, appropriate line spacing
- Monospace: For logs, code, and technical data

### Layout Principles
- Grid-based layout for consistency
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Progressive disclosure for complex information
- Consistent spacing using 8px base unit

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Color contrast ratios meet minimum requirements
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Alternative text for data visualizations

### Inclusive Design
- Support for motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
- High contrast mode availability
- Scalable text up to 200% without loss of functionality
- Multiple ways to access the same information

## Interactive Patterns

### Real-time Updates
- Server-Sent Events for live data streaming
- Visual indicators for data freshness
- Optimistic UI updates with error handling
- Graceful degradation when connection is lost

### Data Visualization
- Progressive enhancement from tables to charts
- Interactive tooltips with contextual information
- Zoom and pan capabilities for detailed analysis
- Export functionality for all visualizations

### Form Interactions
- Inline validation with helpful error messages
- Auto-save for long forms
- Progressive disclosure for advanced options
- Clear indication of required vs optional fields

## Performance Considerations

### Loading States
- Skeleton screens for initial page loads
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Lazy loading for off-screen components
- Clear progress indicators for long operations

### Data Management
- Pagination for large tables (50 items per page)
- Virtual scrolling for very large lists
- Client-side caching with TTL
- Debounced search and filtering

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Error States
